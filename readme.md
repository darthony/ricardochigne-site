# [Ricardo Chigne Website](http://ricardochigne.com)
This is the site of my friend @rerres he is professional photographer

to carry it out, I decided to combine some opensource web projects.

I always start my web projects with a base, I used [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
 `git clone git://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/zipball/master)

for sliding page effect, I used 
[PageSlide](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/pageslide/) `git clone git://github.com/srobbin/jquery-pageslide.git`
